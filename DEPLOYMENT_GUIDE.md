# GoDaddy Deployment Guide

## What You Need

Your application has been built and is ready for deployment. You'll need:

1. **Node.js hosting** - Your GoDaddy plan must support Node.js applications
2. **PostgreSQL database** - You'll need a database service
3. **Environment variables** - Your YouTube API key and database connection

## Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Full-Stack Deployment (Recommended if GoDaddy supports Node.js)

1. **Upload all files from the `dist` folder** to your GoDaddy hosting:
   - `index.js` (your server)
   - `public/` folder (your website files)

2. **Set up environment variables** in your GoDaddy hosting panel:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_youtube_api_key_here
   DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
   ```

3. **Start the application** by running `node index.js`

### Option 2: Static Files Only (If GoDaddy doesn't support Node.js)

**Important:** This won't work because your app needs the backend for YouTube API calls and database connections.

## Alternative Hosting Solutions

If GoDaddy doesn't support Node.js applications, consider these alternatives:

1. **Vercel** (easiest for full-stack apps)
2. **Netlify** (with serverless functions)
3. **Heroku** (simple Node.js deployment)
4. **Railway** (modern deployment platform)

## Database Requirements

Your app needs PostgreSQL. You'll need:
- A PostgreSQL database server
- Connection URL in format: `postgresql://username:password@host:port/database`

## Files Ready for Upload

✓ **dist/index.js** - Your server application
✓ **dist/public/** - Your website files (HTML, CSS, JS)
✓ **Total size:** ~350KB

The application is fully built and optimized for production!
