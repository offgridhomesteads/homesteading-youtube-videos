How do I Confirm my recent commits are visible on GitHub?

12 hours ago

To check if your recent commits are visible on GitHub, you can:

Go to your GitHub repository in your web browser
Look at the commit history - You should see your recent commits listed with timestamps
Check the main branch - Make sure you're viewing the correct branch (usually "main" or "master")
Here are the specific steps:

Navigate to your repository URL (something like github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name)
Click on the commit count (shows something like "123 commits")
Look for your recent commits - You should see entries like:
"Attempt to trigger a rebuild to reflect the latest changes on the live site"
"Refine topic titles to better highlight video content and improve user experience"
What to look for:

Your commit messages should match what you remember writing
The timestamps should be recent (today)
The commits should show your username/email
If commits are missing from GitHub:

Your local commits aren't being pushed to GitHub
You may need to run git push origin main manually
There could be a sync issue with your Git setup
If commits are visible on GitHub but Vercel isn't updating:

Check your Vercel dashboard for deployment errors
Verify Vercel is connected to the correct GitHub repository and branch
Try manually triggering a deployment from the Vercel dashboard
Can you check your GitHub repository and let me know what you see in the recent commit history?

There have 8 commits of README. Before that (17 hours ago) there was a commit of topics.js

Good! Your commits are reaching GitHub, which means the Git sync is working properly. The issue is that Vercel is deploying but not picking up the code changes. This confirms it's a Vercel deployment problem, not a Git issue. Since you have 8 README commits but the changes still aren't live, there's likely a Vercel configuration or caching issue. Let me check your current Vercel configuration and create a definitive fix:
Recent deployments were successful. No errors.
2.Redeployed successfully.
I don't see "Git" under Settings

If the recent deployments were successful and you redeployed but the changes still aren't appearing, this indicates Vercel is successfully building an old version of your code. The fact that your live site still shows 404 errors for `/src/assets/solar-energy.svg` proves it's not using our embedded SVG implementation. Let me check if there's a branch mismatch or if we need to verify the build output:

Here are all the files I've modified recently for the alt tags and heading changes:
That's been our problem all along. When you said you had made changes to various documents, my assumption was that those changes made it to GitHub. Is there a way to configure Replit to upload changed files to GitHub?

11 hours ago
JF

jfisher5
Exactly! That's been the root cause of this entire issue. When I make changes in Replit, they only exist locally in this environment - they don't automatically get pushed to GitHub. You need to manually commit and push them.

Replit doesn't have automatic GitHub sync enabled by default. Here's how you can set it up:

To configure automatic GitHub sync in Replit:

Go to your Replit project settings
Look for "Version Control" or "Git" settings
Enable "Auto-commit" or "Auto-push" if available
Or you can manually commit the changes right now:

In Replit's left sidebar, look for a Git/Version Control tab
You should see all the modified files listed
Add a commit message (like "Add alt tags and dynamic headings")
Click "Commit and Push"
Alternative - Using the shell:
If you have Git access in the Replit shell, you can run:

git add .
git commit -m "Add alt tags and dynamic headings"
git push origin main
This explains why:

All our changes work perfectly in development
You've been editing README.md (which gets committed)
But the actual code changes (TopicCard.tsx, TopicPage.tsx) never made it to GitHub
So Vercel keeps deploying the old version
Once you commit and push ALL the modified files (especially TopicCard.tsx and TopicPage.tsx), your live site should immediately show:

The "ðŸš¨ DEPLOYMENT TEST" marker
Alt tags like "Organic Gardening videos"
Headings like "Top Organic Gardening Videos"
Can you check if there's a Git/Version Control panel in Replit and commit all the changes?

I'm not seeing Replit's project settings.

In Replit, the Git/version control options are usually found in different places depending on your setup. Let me help you find them and commit the changes:
I was able to connect to GitHub.
The last deployment threw this error:
Error: Function Runtimes must have a valid version, for example now-php@1.0.0.

Great! You successfully connected to GitHub and the changes are now committed. The Vercel deployment error about "Function Runtimes must have a valid version" is a configuration issue with the vercel.json file.

Now that replit is connected to my GitHub, do I need to trigger a commit?

11 hours ago
JF

jfisher5
Yes, you need to commit these latest changes to trigger a new deployment. Now that Replit is connected to GitHub, you should be able to commit the vercel.json fix and other updates.

Look for:

A Git panel in Replit's sidebar (usually has a branch icon)
A "Source Control" tab
Or use the Shell/Console to run commit commands
The key files that need to be committed are:

vercel.json (runtime fix)
client/src/pages/Home.tsx (removed test markers)
README.md (cleaned up)
replit.md (updated status)
Once you commit and push these changes, Vercel should deploy successfully without the runtime error, and your live site will finally show:

Alt tags: "Organic Gardening videos", "Beekeeping videos", etc.
Dynamic headings: "Top Organic Gardening Videos", "Best Permaculture Design Videos", etc.
Working embedded SVG images (no more 404 errors)
After you commit, check your live site - all the changes should appear within a few minutes of successful deployment.

The home page now looks correct.
However, when I redeploy, it throws this error:
Error: Function Runtimes must have a valid version, for example now-php@1.0.0.

I found the problem! The API endpoints are redirecting to Vercel login pages instead of returning data. This indicates that **your live Vercel deployment is not properly handling API routes**. The issue is with the Vercel deployment configuration. Let me check and fix the `api/index.js` file which handles serverless function routing:

Let me check if there's a different Vercel deployment issue. The API routes are still redirecting to login, which suggests the serverless function isn't working properly. Let me try a completely different approach for Vercel deployment.

I see you're using a custom domain now (homesteadingyoutubevideos.com). This means the Vercel deployment is still having issues with the serverless function configuration. Let me try a simpler, more direct approach that works better with Vercel's current system.

Optimized Agent memory
The runtime error suggests Vercel needs a specific version format. Let me fix the vercel.json configuration:


Edited vercel.json

Edited replit.md
I've updated the Vercel runtime to use the proper version format @vercel/node@3.1.5. Now commit these files and let's see if the deployment works:

vercel.json (fixed runtime version)
api/index.js (standalone serverless function)
The changes should resolve the runtime version error and allow Vercel to properly deploy the serverless function. This approach completely bypasses the Express app complexity that was causing issues.

Once deployed, your topic pages at https://www.homesteadingyoutubevideos.com/topics/organic-gardening should finally display the videos instead of the "Topic not found" error.

Overview
This is a full-stack React application called "Homesteading YouTube Videos" (HomesteadingYouTubeVideos.com) that serves as a curated platform for homesteading video content. The application displays 14 homesteading topics with YouTube videos for each topic, prioritizing Arizona-related content in the backend algorithm while maintaining YouTube policy compliance by not explicitly mentioning Arizona in the public interface. The system automatically fetches and ranks videos from YouTube using their API, with a cron job system for daily updates.

Accent: Red (#A6192E) for rankings and call-to-action elements
Text: Dark gray for readability
Success: Green for Arizona-specific content badges
