Excellent! The live API is working - it's returning all 14 topics. Now let me test the specific endpoints that the topic pages need:

The serverless function is still crashing. Let me create a simpler, more robust version that avoids the complex Drizzle schema definitions and uses direct SQL queries instead:

The serverless function is still crashing. Let me try a completely different approach - I'll create the simplest possible serverless function that bypasses all the complex dependencies:

The serverless function is still crashing even with the simplest possible code. This suggests the issue might be with the vercel.json configuration or the way Vercel is handling the function. Let me try a different approach by using Vercel's standard API routes format:

The base `/api/topics` endpoint works, but the dynamic routes are still failing. This suggests Vercel isn't recognizing the file structure properly. Let me fix the file paths and structure:

The dynamic route is still failing. Let me check if there's an issue with the file naming or try a different approach. Let me also verify the current file structure and try a simpler nested approach:

Excellent! The static routes work perfectly! The topic page is loading and showing videos. You're seeing only 2 videos because I used sample data for testing. Now I need to connect this to your real database with all the actual YouTube videos. Let me update the static route to fetch real data from your database and create routes for all 14 topics:

Yes, the videos.js files are nearly identical - they only differ in the slug parameter. Let me create a more efficient solution by generating all the remaining static routes at once:

That tells us the API route is working (no 404 error), but there are no videos in your database for the organic-gardening topic. Let me check what's actually in your database:

If the videos.js files are all so similar, wouldn't it be better to have one videos.js file and call in the info that's different? That way, if we ever need to change videos.js, there's only one file to change.

You're absolutely right! Having 28 nearly identical files (14 topic routes + 14 video routes) is inefficient and hard to maintain. Let me create a single dynamic route that works properly instead of all these static files.

I see the issue - Vercel's Hobby plan has a 12 serverless function limit, and we're hitting that. Let me check how many API routes we currently have and consolidate them into a single API handler.

Consolidate API routes to address function limits and improve performance

I've successfully consolidated your API from 8+ files down to just 1 file to solve the Vercel 12-function limit issue. Here's what I completed:

✓ Removed all duplicate API files (28 static routes + extras)
✓ Created single consolidated api/index.js handler
✓ Updated Express server with new /api endpoint
✓ Modified frontend to use query parameters (?action=topic&slug=...)
✓ Reduced API complexity from multiple files to one maintainable file

The consolidated API now handles:

/api - Returns all topics
/api?action=topic&slug=X - Returns specific topic
/api?action=videos&slug=X - Returns videos for topic
This should resolve the Vercel deployment error about exceeding the 12 serverless function limit. How does this solution look for your maintenance needs?

Which files do I need to commit?

You need to commit these files that were changed to implement the consolidated API solution:

Files to commit:

api/index.js - The new consolidated API handler (replaces 8+ old files)
server/routes.ts - Updated with the new /api endpoint
client/src/pages/TopicPage.tsx - Updated to use query parameters
client/src/pages/Home.tsx - Updated API endpoint
replit.md - Documentation updates
Files that were deleted (good to commit the deletions):

All the old API files in api/ directory (topic.js, videos.js, topics.js, etc.)
Git commands:

git add .
git commit -m "Consolidate API routes to fix Vercel 12-function limit
- Replace 8+ API files with single api/index.js handler
- Add query parameter support (?action=topic&slug=X)
- Update frontend to use consolidated endpoints
- Resolve Vercel Hobby plan function count limitation"
This consolidation reduces your serverless function count from 8+ down to just 1, which should resolve the Vercel deployment error you encountered.

Overview
This is a full-stack React application called "Homesteading YouTube Videos" (HomesteadingYouTubeVideos.com) that serves as a curated platform for homesteading video content. The application displays 14 homesteading topics with YouTube videos for each topic, prioritizing Arizona-related content in the backend algorithm while maintaining YouTube policy compliance by not explicitly mentioning Arizona in the public interface. The system automatically fetches and ranks videos from YouTube using their API, with a cron job system for daily updates.

User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

System Architecture
Frontend Architecture
Framework: React 18 with TypeScript
Routing: Wouter for client-side routing
State Management: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
UI Framework: Radix UI components with shadcn/ui styling
Styling: Tailwind CSS with custom color scheme (Navajo County inspired)
Build Tool: Vite with custom configuration for development and production
Backend Architecture
Runtime: Node.js with Express.js server
Language: TypeScript with ES modules
API Pattern: RESTful API with JSON responses
Database ORM: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
Database: PostgreSQL (configured for Neon serverless)
Background Jobs: Node-cron for scheduled video updates
Data Flow
Initial Load: Frontend requests topics from /api/topics
Topic Pages: Frontend requests videos for specific topics from /api/topics/:slug/videos
Video Updates: Daily cron job fetches fresh video data from YouTube API
Video Ranking: Custom algorithm ranks videos based on popularity, recency, and Arizona relevance
Key Components
Database Schema
Topics Table: Stores 14 predefined homesteading categories with slugs
YouTube Videos Table: Caches video metadata, statistics, and computed scores
Users/Sessions Tables: Authentication infrastructure (for potential future use)
YouTube Integration
Search Strategy: Primary search for "{topic} homesteading Arizona", fallback to general homesteading
Ranking Algorithm: Combines like count, video age, relevance weight, and recency weight
Content Preference: Videos with regional relevance get higher scores (labeled as "Specialized Content")
Channel Diversity: Limits to 2 videos per channel to ensure variety
Policy Compliance: Backend maintains Arizona focus while frontend displays generic homesteading content
UI Components
TopicCard: Displays topic information with thumbnail and navigation
VideoCard: Shows video details with ranking badges and social sharing
Navigation: Responsive header with mobile menu support
SocialShareButtons: Integrated sharing for X, Instagram, and Facebook
Services
YouTubeService: Handles API requests, video fetching, and ranking calculations
CronService: Manages scheduled tasks and topic initialization
Storage Interface: Abstraction layer for database operations
External Dependencies
Required APIs
YouTube Data API v3: For fetching video content and statistics
Requires YOUTUBE_API_KEY environment variable
Uses search.list and videos.list endpoints
Database
PostgreSQL: Primary data storage
Requires DATABASE_URL environment variable
Uses Neon serverless driver for connection pooling
Third-Party Libraries
UI Components: Extensive Radix UI component library
Styling: Tailwind CSS with custom theme variables
HTTP Client: Native fetch API with React Query
Date Handling: date-fns for date manipulation
Validation: Zod schemas with Drizzle integration
Deployment Strategy
Build Process
Frontend Build: Vite compiles React app to static assets in dist/public
Backend Build: esbuild bundles server code to dist/index.js
Database Setup: Drizzle migrations applied via db:push command
Environment Configuration
Development: Uses tsx for hot reloading with Vite middleware
Production: Serves static files and API from single Express server
Database: Drizzle handles schema management and migrations
Key Features
Responsive Design: Mobile-first approach with desktop enhancements
SEO Optimization: Server-side rendering preparation and semantic HTML
Performance: Lazy loading images and efficient query caching
Accessibility: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support
Color Scheme
The application uses a Navajo County-inspired color palette:

Primary: Dark blue (#003682) for headers and navigation
Background: Navajo white for warm, earthy feel
Accent: Red (#A6192E) for rankings and call-to-action elements
Text: Dark gray for readability
Success: Green for Arizona-specific content badges
