Create a WordPress theme named “Operation Self-Reliance” for a PHP website to be uploaded to a GoDaddy WordPress server. The theme should include a homepage and 14 subpages, each named after a specific homesteading topic, displaying YouTube video thumbnails and information for homesteading resources, with a focus on Arizona. Below are the detailed requirements:1. Theme Structure:Generate a WordPress theme folder named operation-self-reliance-theme with the following files:style.css: Theme metadata (name: “Operation Self-Reliance”, author: “Your Name”, version: 1.0) and CSS styling.
index.php: Homepage template displaying the title, SEO paragraph, and 14 homesteading topics.
functions.php: For enqueuing styles/scripts, registering custom page templates, and YouTube API integration.
14 custom page templates named after the topics (without “page-” prefix):organic-gardening.php
raising-chickens.php
permaculture-design.php
food-preservation.php
water-harvesting.php
solar-energy.php
composting.php
beekeeping.php
livestock-management.php
herbal-medicine.php
diy-home-maintenance.php
soil-building-in-arid-climates.php
off-grid-water-systems.php
homestead-security.php
Optional: JavaScript file (e.g., scripts.js) for dynamic features like lazy-loading thumbnails.
2. Homepage (index.php):Title: “Operation Self-Reliance’s Top Recommended Homesteading Videos” in a <h1> tag.
SEO Paragraph: Include a single paragraph below the title, optimized for the phrase “Top Homesteading Videos”. Example: “Discover the Top Homesteading Videos curated by Operation Self-Reliance, featuring expert tutorials on organic gardening, raising chickens, water harvesting, and more, with a focus on Arizona homesteading. Our handpicked selection of the best YouTube content helps you master self-sufficiency with practical, high-quality videos updated daily.”Ensure the paragraph is 50–70 words, includes “Top Homesteading Videos” naturally 2–3 times, and uses related keywords (e.g., “self-sufficiency”, “Arizona homesteading”).
Layout:Desktop: Two-column layout (7 rows in the first column, 7 in the second, for 14 topics). Each row contains:Left: YouTube video thumbnail (320x180px, medium quality from API).
Right: Topic name in bold (e.g., “Organic Gardening”), a short sentence describing the topic (e.g., “Growing fruits and vegetables without synthetic pesticides.”), and a link to the corresponding subpage (e.g., /organic-gardening).
Mobile: Single-column list of all 14 topics, sorted alphabetically, with thumbnail, topic name, and description stacked vertically.
Each topic links to its respective subpage.

3. Subpages (Custom Page Templates):Each subpage (e.g., organic-gardening.php) corresponds to one of the 14 homesteading topics.
Layout:Desktop: Two-column layout (6 rows per column) displaying 12 YouTube videos per topic. Each row includes:Left: Video thumbnail (320x180px).
Right: Video title, a short description (from YouTube API), and a ranking number (1–12) in red (#A6192E) based on popularity.
Mobile: Single-column list of 12 videos, sorted by popularity rank (1–12).
Use the YouTube Data API v3 to fetch 12 videos per topic, with at least 4 Arizona-specific videos, ensuring no more than 2 videos from the same channel.

4. YouTube API Integration:Use the YouTube Data API v3 (search.list and videos.list) to fetch 12 videos per topic.
Search queries:Primary: {topic} homesteading Arizona (e.g., “organic gardening homesteading Arizona”).
Fallback (if <4 Arizona videos): {topic} homesteading.
Video ranking formula: Popularity Score = (Like Count / Age in Months) × Relevance Weight × Recency WeightLike Count: From videos.list (statistics.likeCount).
Age in Months: (Current Date - publishedAt) / 30 (assume 1 month = 30 days).
Relevance Weight:1.0 for Arizona-specific videos (title/description/tags contain “Arizona”).
0.75 for general homesteading videos, 0.9 if highly relevant to the topic.
Recency Weight:1.0 for videos <1 year old.
0.9 for 1–2 years old.
0.8 for >2 years old.
Filter results to limit to 2 videos per channel (channelId).
Cache video data (ID, title, description, thumbnail URL, likes, publishedAt, channelId) in a WordPress database (e.g., custom table or wp_options) and update daily via a cron job.
Securely store the YouTube API key in wp-config.php or WordPress settings.
Sanitize API outputs to prevent XSS/injection vulnerabilities.

5. Design and Styling (style.css):Colors (inspired by Navajo County website):Background: Navajo White/Tan (#F5E6CC).
Headers/Navigation: Dark Blue (#003087).
Accents/Links/Ranking Numbers: Red (#A6192E).
Text: Gray (#4A4A4A).
Thumbnail Borders/Icons: Green (#3A5F0B).
Fonts:Body: Roboto or Open Sans (sans-serif, readable).
Headings: Lora (rustic, homesteading-inspired).
Thumbnails: Uniform 320x180px, with 2px green border.
Spacing: 20px between rows, 10px between columns, ensuring a clean, uncluttered layout.
Responsive Design: Use CSS media queries to switch to single-column on mobile (screen width <768px).

6. WordPress Compatibility:Follow WordPress theme standards (e.g., proper template hierarchy, escaping outputs).
Register the 14 custom page templates in functions.php so they can be assigned to WordPress pages (e.g., page with slug organic-gardening uses organic-gardening.php).
Ensure the theme is uploadable to GoDaddy’s WordPress hosting (wp-content/themes/).
Allow manual addition of WordPress plugins (e.g., Contact Form 7, Social Warfare) for feedback forms and social sharing buttons (do not implement these in the theme).

7. Additional Requirements:Optimize for performance (e.g., lazy-load thumbnails, cache API data).
Ensure accessibility (e.g., alt text for thumbnails with topic/video titles, semantic HTML).
Generate a zip file of the theme folder for easy upload to WordPress.
Include a README.md with instructions for:Uploading the theme to GoDaddy WordPress via the admin dashboard or FTP.
Creating 14 WordPress pages with slugs matching the topic names (e.g., organic-gardening) and assigning the corresponding templates.
Obtaining and configuring a YouTube API key in wp-config.php.
Output:Create all theme files in a Replit project.
Ensure the theme is testable in Replit’s PHP environment before export.
Provide the zip file for download and clear instructions in README.md.
